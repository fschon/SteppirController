# SteppirController - Remote low cost Steppir antenna controller. 

I recently acquired a 10 year old Steppir 3 element antenna missing the controller. Due to the age of the antenna, I did not want to invest in a new controller and so looked into the idea of using 3d printer electronics to build my own. 

This project uses a Big Tree Tech Octopus 1.1, a Raspberry Pi and Klipper, Moonraker and Node Red software as a replacement. Total cost so far is under $150. The controller can probably also be used to control a antenna rotator as well.

Because the controller uses a Node Red dashboard, the controller can be remotely operated and the controller electronics located closer to the antenna, alleviating the need to run long control cables to my shack.
